## 💻 Code Summary

<details><summary>Root</summary>

| File | Summary |
| ---- | ------- |
| decimal_to_binary.py |  The code defines a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes an integer `num` as input and converts it to binary by recursively dividing the number by 2 until the quotient is 0, at which point the remainder is printed. The function has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input decimal number. |
| unit_test.py |  The code defines a function named decimal_to_binary that takes an integer as input and returns its binary representation as a string. It also includes a unittest class to test the function's functionality. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

 To get started with this project, follow these steps:<br>
1. Open the `decimal_to_binary.py` script in your preferred text editor or IDE.
2. Read through the code to understand how the script works and what it does.
3. Run the unit test by executing the `unit_test.py` script. This will ensure that the script is working correctly.
4. Use the script to convert decimal numbers to binary by calling it with the appropriate arguments. For example, you can call the script with the following command: `python decimal_to_binary.py`
